Autoenv
=======
Integrates [zsh-autoenv][1] into Prezto, which automatically sources
(known/whitelisted) `.autoenv.zsh` files, typically used in project root
directories.

It handles "enter" and leave" events, nesting, and stashing of
variables (overwriting and restoring).

Contributors
------------

New features and bug fixes should be submitted to the [zsh-autoenv][1]
project according to its rules and regulations. This module will be synchronized
against it.
